## Introduction
This vignette demonstrates the use of the `RecordLinkage` package in R for performing entity resolution tasks. It focuses on two key functionalities: weight-based deduplication and supervised classification. These techniques are commonly used in record linkage to identify and remove duplicate records from datasets and to classify matches and non-matches based on various supervised machine learning models.

The vignette covers the steps from generating record pairs to performing deduplication using both the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and various supervised learning methods. Additionally, it explores the performance metrics associated with classification, such as alpha and beta error rates, accuracy, precision, and recall.
